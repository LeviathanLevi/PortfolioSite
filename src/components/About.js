              Hi, I'm Levi.
              <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />I'm a Software Engineer
            </h1>
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            I'm 22 years old, and I was born in southern Oregon. Growing up I always has a passion for technology, whether it was computer hardware, 3D animation, virtual reality, robotics, game development, or programming. I knew that I wanted to work with computers, so in highschool when I went to community college for a dual enrollment program, I started studying software engineering. I later transfered to Oregon Tech where I graduated with my bachelorâ€™s in software engineering technology. Currently, I'm finishing up my 2nd internship to conclude the MECOP program.
