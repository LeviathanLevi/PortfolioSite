              Hi, I'm Levi.
              <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />I'm a Software Engineer
            </h1>
            <p className="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Growing up I always had a passion for technology, whether it was computer hardware, 3D animation, virtual reality, robotics, game development, or programming. So, in high school, I dual enrolled at Rogue Community College to get a head start on a career in software engineering. This later allowed me to transfer to Oregon Tech and hit the ground running, completing my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering Technology early. Currently, Iâ€™m finishing up my second MECOP internship at Daimler Trucks NA and exploring full-time opportunities that will allow me to wear many hats and keep growing as an engineer.
